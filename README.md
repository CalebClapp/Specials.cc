Specials.cc
-----------

Dynamically displayed specials for restaurants, bars and other businesses in and around Bellingham, WA. The plan is to keep it an open platform so anyone can contribute as existing businesses alter their menus and new businesses setup shop around the area.

Things to do
============

* Convert the ugly switch statement (done, soon, active) into something more modular.
* Remove the pager when there is only a single table row returned in a specials block.
* Add address, phone number, lattitude/longitude and type to the "places" for eventual filtering functionality.

Ideas for Extending
===================

* Create functionality for separting food and drink specials (happy hour).
* Create functionality for choosing deals specific to a section of bham (downtown, woodhood, fairhaven, etc.).
