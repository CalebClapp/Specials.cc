Downtown Bham Lunch Menu
------------------------

This will eventually be a dynamic lunch menu for restaurants in downtown Bellingham, WA. The plan is to keep it an open platform so anyone can update the entries as menus change and new businesses setup shop around the downtown area.

Things to do
============

* Fix the expiration timer (was showing 20:xx when should have been 3:xx).
* Create $debug variable to set $start and $end vars to far earlier / far later.
* If start time is in next 3 hours, put entry in "Upcoming Specials" div.
* Get Tablesorter pagination working correctly.
* Add address, phone number and tags to the restaurants for eventual filtering functionality.
